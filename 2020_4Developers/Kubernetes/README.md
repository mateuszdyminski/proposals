## Short Abstract (up to 500 words)

There are a lot of examples how to move application to the Kubernetes, but you wan't find much info how to run your database on K8s platform. Many developers and DevOps avoid even touching the data storage layer by repeating clich√©s: "applications in containers must be stateless", "writes done by container apps are slow", "storing data on k8s requires distributed storage" or "never run DB on k8s". Time to deal with these myths and understand how storage works on K8s!

Why does everyone thinks it's so complicated? What is PersistentVolume? What is PersistentVolumeClaim? Why do we have both components and how do they interact with each other? What's Local storage? How to write scalable applications that are not always stateless? How to debug K8s when something connected with storage went wrong? What's Container Storage Interface?

I will try to answer these questions! Hopefully you will leave the room with better understanding of K8s storage.
