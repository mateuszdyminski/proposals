### Title:
Zero-Downtime deployments with Kubernetes

### Tags:

### Abstract:
Developers, Ops teams, and end users have always been nervous about deployments because maintenance windows had a tendency to expand, causing unwanted downtime. Teams of ops engineers used to handle deployment efforts by-hand or via scripting - this process might could take hours, if not all night. The revolutionary Kubernetes deployment system, on the other hand, has built-in features that automate this operations effort, where end-user wan't be able to notice that the application version has changed in meantime. The presentation shows the technics which we as developers might use to make the deployment smooth and invisible for our users. Of course the work needs to be done on both sides: development and operations to achieve our Zero-Downtime goal - so presentation would be rather code and Kubernetes examples heavy than the plain theory.

### Message for the program committee, motivation for your presentation:
Motivation for my presentation is showing to people how zero-downtime deployments are easy to achive when they have Kubernetes on their side. Additionally presentation helps attendees to understand what graceful shutdown is, what are the main benefits of it and how can you set up the graceful shutdown of a Kubernetes application. I’ll discuss how you can validate and benchmark this process, and what are the most common mistakes that you should avoid. 

From a business point of view, deployments can and should be frequent, without fear of hitting a point of no return. In the past, software teams sometimes delivered features that were backwards incompatible — if something went wrong during the deployment, there was trouble. That's why my presentation is not only for developers but also for people from business - to show how switching to Kubernetes might help them to release the product more ofter and in more stable way.

To sum that up, my presentation starts from the introduction to the problem of cloud, frequent deployments, but I can't leave this problem without the solution. I am a the tech person so there will be many code and Kubernetes examples which definitely show how this solution might have been achieved. Attendees won't regret that they have chosen my presentation! Promise!
