## Short Abstract (up to 500 words)

In the presentation I'll show you what Change Data Capture (CDC) is and how the architecture of your application may become better using this concept.

The most important thing in the presentation will be showing how to use CDC to transform “application <-> database” architecture to the world of data-stream architecture. With CDC, we can create efficient and scalable systems, as well as it is possible to transfer our architecture to the world of asynchrony and quickly react to any changes in the system. It is not as difficult as it may seem, which will be presented based on the series of examples and demos shown in the presentation.

Agenda:

* What is CDC
* When and where we can use the CDC
* How to easily change an existing architecture with CDC
* Streaming Data Architecture - what it is and why CDC can help here
* Synchronization of caches, search engines or data lakes based on CDC
