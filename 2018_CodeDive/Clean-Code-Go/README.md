### Title:
Clean Code in GO

### Tags:
Go, Best-Practicies, Clean Code

### Abstract:
There is plenty of definitions of "clean code”, every programmer has its own, every language has its own, and of course, everyone when he thinks about the clean code - has the book written by Uncle Bob (Robert C. Martin) in front of his eyes. But what happened when we confront the definitions created by some IT gurus with Go language specification and decisions which were made during inventing Go? Is writing if err != nil hundreds of times clean? 

In my presentation I’ll try to answer this and many more questions which you could have in your mind when starting your journey with Go. The general idea behind my talk is to prove that:
Writing clean code in Go is really easy
Go is cleanest programming language
Every programmer should give a chance to Go
 
Probably you ask yourself a question: “Is this presentation worth to see?”:

Do you have some experience with Go, but you are still complaining on syntax and error checking? Great! I'll try to explain why creators of Go made particular decisions to make the code written in Go clean.

No experience at all? - even better! You will understand why Go seems to be ugly and primitive but it does great job when it comes to cleanliness.

Go expert? - Ok - you could find something better than my talk in the agenda : )
