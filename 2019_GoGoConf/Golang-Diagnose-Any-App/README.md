### Title:
Diagnose your Golang App anytime anywhere!

### Tags:
Go, Golang, Best Practicies, Performance, Monitoring, Tracing, Profiling, Instrumenting

### Elevator pitch:
The Go ecosystem provides a large suite of APIs and tools to diagnose logic and performance problems in Go programs. This presentation summaries them and shows how to pick the right one for the specific problem. Be prepare for lots of code samples and demos of profiling, tracing and debugging!

### Description:
The Go ecosystem provides a large suite of APIs and tools to diagnose logic and performance problems in Go programs. This presentation summarizes the available tools and shows how to pick the right one for the specific problem.

Following aspects will be covered during the presentation:

* Profiling - how to profile Go application, what kind of profiles are available in Go tool pprof, examples how to find find problems with CPU and Memory 
* Tracing - how to trace Go, application, examples with analyze application latency in a Go process
* Debugging - how to debug Go application, what need's to enabled to debug app and how to debug app remotely
* Runtime statistics and events - how to print and access events and stats collected by package runtime
* Instrumenting - how to instrument and trace application with external tools like Zipking and Prometheus 

Hopefully, leaving the room everyone will know how to diagnose their Golang application!

### Notes:
Motivation for my presentation is showing to people how to write Go application with full support of all APIs and tools to diagnose logic and performance problems. Additionally, presentation helps attendees to understand what definitions like profiling, tracing, debugging or instrumenting mean. After the theory part I'll take the participants for the journey full of demos how to find and diagnose the problems with your Go app. I am a the tech person so there will be many code and demos which definitely show how this solution might have been achieved. Attendees won't regret that they have chosen my presentation! Promise!
